        What have I learned from writing eight papers over the past four years? Although this question can be answered from various angles, such as providing a detailed description of the identified research gaps followed by a critical analysis of the methodologies used and results gathered for each of the eight papers, my focus here is rather simple and straightforward.

I would like to share with you some rather more personal and somewhat surprising aspects of the writing of the eight papers. So let us begin:</p><h2 id=lesson-1-reward-is-more-personal-than-social class="relative group">Lesson 1: Reward is more personal than social <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style=text-decoration-line:none!important href=#lesson-1-reward-is-more-personal-than-social aria-label=Anchor>#</a></span></h2><p>Let&rsquo;s face it, most of you (dear readers) who will come across this post are people who know me personally or were recommended this article by one of our mutual acquaintances. The chance that any of you have actually read all eight papers I have written is considerably small and that is exactly my point. The real readers of your work, people who will pick up your ideas and test their validity in the real world, will probably never cross your path. The people around you are more likely to notice that you were stressed to meet deadlines, that you skipped social gatherings or that you were mentally absent from social gatherings while trying to get your articles across the finish line and eventually receive a link of published articles. Personally, I perform better when I concentrate on one project at a time. But that means other projects and aspects of your life can be affected. When I wrote my first papers, I was totally focused on finishing the best possible draft and submitting it for further consideration. Instead of hanging out with my friends on Friday nights, I worked on the r-studio code of my research data to test different hypotheses and identify new interdependencies. I vividly remember many such incidents where I had to prioritise my precious papers over other, more interesting social events. So one might naturally wonder what all this is about and what I have learned from it.</p><p>The first crucial thing I learned was that the <em>“reward”</em> is rather more personal than social. Starting from an idea and than going through all the ups and downs of paper writing and publishing process strengthens your mind. You learn that to trust yourself and become more patient. <strong>Having a self belief that you can handle the ups and down of life is probably the best armour one can have</strong> and no matter how you acquire it that is what you need to shape your dreams into reality. You also learn to become more humble and modest because you realize that your success is the result of all the people who supported you in this process. I am grateful to all the support I received and hope to be a good support to people in my social surroundings. Finally, here are two photos of me that I found, for the history books :D (just kidding), to document my personal growth over the years.</p><p><figure><picture class="mx-auto my-0 rounded-md"><source srcset="/website/posts/first-post/fp2_hu7f67076ce92fd71e2ac62b7ed50a279b_11441505_330x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 330w,/website/posts/first-post/fp2_hu7f67076ce92fd71e2ac62b7ed50a279b_11441505_660x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 660w

Like when I had two major revisions right before the holidays and had to adjust my focus and go into peak performance mode instead of holiday mode in a matter of days. What I learned is that a challenge brings out the best in you. When the stacks are against you and you are cornered, you can do wonders. There are countless examples in sport where an underdog team ends up winning the championship. The point is that we should start enjoying the journey we are on and not worry too much about the destination. Just like when, on a hike in the Italian Alps, I focused on the next step on this path and got to see amazing views.</p><p><figure><picture class="mx-auto my-0 rounded-md"><source srcset="/website/posts/first-post/fp1_hu032604b457e325bfd2a2d6c65d3dd36d_1851002_330x0_resize_q75_h2_box.webp 330w,/website/posts/first-post/fp1_hu032604b457e325bfd2a2d6c65d3dd36d_1851002_660x0_resize_q75_h2_box.webp 660w

So in my case, the publication of a paper should be a success. While that is partly true, I think the <strong>real success is learning to deal with the stress and time pressure</strong> involved in the publishing process <strong>and developing the necessary skills</strong> to work with your co-authors. If I had not received major revisions and my papers were just accepted after the first submission, I would never have learned how to concentrate and stay calm under extreme time pressure.</p><h2 id=conclusion class="relative group">Conclusion <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style=text-decoration-line:none!important href=#conclusion aria-label=Anchor>#</a></span></h2><p>To sum up, I feel that writing eight papers in four years has made me a better person, not because I now have eight publications, but because this process has made me more confident, more patient, more humble and more modest.</p><blockquote><p>My take-home message is this: learn to enjoy the journey you are on and remember that the greatest reward for all your hard work is that you become a better version of yourself and become someone you and your loved ones can be proud of</p></blockquote></div></section><footer class="max-w-prose pt-8 print:hidden"><div class=flex><picture class="!mb-0 !mt-0 me-4 w-24 h-auto rounded-full"><img width=502 height=502 class="!mb-0 !mt-0 me-4 w-24 h-auto rounded-full" alt="Yawar Baloch" loading=lazy decoding=async src=/website/img/Pro3.jpg></picture><div class=place-self-center><div class="text-[0.6rem] uppercase leading-3 text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400">Author</div><div class="font-semibold leading-6 text-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-300">Yawar Baloch</div><div class="text-sm text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-400">I am a positive minded person</div><div class="text-2xl sm:text-lg"><div class="flex flex-wrap text-neutral-400 dark:text-neutral-500"><a class="px-1 transition-transform hover:scale-125 hover:text-primary-700 dark:hover:text-primary-400" style=will-change:transform href=mailto:yawaarbaloch@gmail.com target=_blank aria-label=Email rel="me noopener noreferrer"><span class="icon relative inline-block px-1 align-text-bottom"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path fill="currentcolor" d="M207.8 20.73c-93.45 18.32-168.7 93.66-187 187.1-27.64 140.9 68.65 266.2 199.1 285.1 19.01 2.888 36.17-12.26 36.17-31.49l1e-4-.6631c0-15.74-11.44-28.88-26.84-31.24-84.35-12.98-149.2-86.13-149.2-174.2.0-102.9 88.61-185.5 193.4-175.4 91.54 8.869 158.6 91.25 158.6 183.2v16.16c0 22.09-17.94 40.05-40 40.05s-40.01-17.96-40.01-40.05v-120.1c0-8.847-7.161-16.02-16.01-16.02l-31.98.0036c-7.299.0-13.2 4.992-15.12 11.68-24.85-12.15-54.24-16.38-86.06-5.106-38.75 13.73-68.12 48.91-73.72 89.64-9.483 69.01 43.81 128 110.9 128 26.44.0 50.43-9.544 69.59-24.88 24 31.3 65.23 48.69 109.4 37.49C465.2 369.3 496 324.1 495.1 277.2V256.3c0-149.2-133.9-265.632-287.3-235.57zM239.1 304.3c-26.47.0-48-21.56-48-48.05s21.53-48.05 48-48.05 48 21.56 48 48.05-20.6 48.05-48 48.05z"/></svg>
