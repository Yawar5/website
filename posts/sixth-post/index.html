As a PhD holder in knowledge management, &ldquo;gut feeling&rdquo; was one of the most popular words I used when I had to explain the concept of tacit knowledge. Tacit knowledge refers to the kind of knowledge that is either difficult or, in some cases, impossible to put into words. So I take the challenge and try to put the idea of gut feeling into words by explaining how you can know your gut feeling.</p><h2 id=when-to-rely-on-gut-feeling class="relative group">When to rely on gut feeling? <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style=text-decoration-line:none!important href=#when-to-rely-on-gut-feeling aria-label=Anchor>#</a></span></h2><p>Personally, I tend to be very thoughtful and rational, which can be an advantage in many situations. But there are moments when gut feeling is one of the best pointers to make a decision. Especially when it comes to very big or very small decisions. Whether you should choose a particular holiday destination or another when both are new to you is, in my humble opinion, a decision we often make based on our gut feeling. While the consequences of small decisions based on gut feeling are not that bad, they are quite significant when it comes to making life-changing decisions based on your gut feeling.</p><h2 id=my-experience class="relative group">My experience <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style=text-decoration-line:none!important href=#my-experience aria-label=Anchor>#</a></span></h2><p>I had such a moment recently when I had to make a career decision between two options. In this case, I had a pretty good idea of one option and liked the general outline of what the position could offer. The other option required a leap of faith and came with a lot of uncertainties. Choosing the first option would have meant developing professionally with the support of people who like you and value what you bring to the table. On the other hand, choosing the second option was, in a metaphorical sense, similar to Casey Neistat, a well-known American Youtuber, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vi7PPResIg&amp;ab_channel=Dansnov1086" target=_blank rel=noreferrer>Tarzan method</a>, and I quote:</p><p><em>If Tarzan never let go of the vine that he was swinging from to grab the next one, he would have never gotten to the other side of the jungle. He just would have sat there swinging back and forth&mldr; Some day I wont be able to do this. The right time is now. Everytime I took these bigger risks, the opportunity for a bigger payout was always there. Some distance can really make you appreciate what you have.</em></p><p>Nevertheless, my mind and heart were split between the two options and it was very difficult for me to know what I really wanted deep down.</p><p><figure><img src=img/6p1.jpeg alt=pic class="mx-auto my-0 rounded-md"></figure></p><h2 id=my-analytical-approach class="relative group">My analytical approach <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style=text-decoration-line:none!important href=#my-analytical-approach aria-label=Anchor>#</a></span></h2><p>So I relied on my natural instinct and tried to ask some people for advice, identify key factors that I thought were important for making a sensible decision, and decided to go to Copenhagen for a long weekend to get away from the everyday noise and get more in touch with myself. Surprisingly, the more my analysis deepened, the harder it was to decide on an option. That&rsquo;s when I realised that I couldn&rsquo;t make a rational decision here, but that I really had to connect with my inner self to make a decision I could be happy with.</p><h2 id=insights-into-my-gut-feeling class="relative group">Insights into my gut feeling <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style=text-decoration-line:none!important href=#insights-into-my-gut-feeling aria-label=Anchor>#</a></span></h2><p>This process began when a good friend told me to recall how I felt when I received both offers and how I immediately reacted to them. This was the <strong>first window</strong> through which I got to know my gut feeling.</p><p>Later, a colleague told me about the infamous <em>coin method</em>. The idea behind it is that you flip a coin based on pre-determined decisions, and once the outcome is known, you observe your feelings: does your heart calm down or do you wish for a different outcome. Of course, we also tried this method, and I remember that before the result was revealed, my heart was beating like crazy, and as soon as the result was known, it calmed down as if it had never been there. That was my <strong>second insight</strong> into my gut feeling.</p><p>The <strong>third insight</strong> came when one of the many wise people I had consulted shared his personal insights with me and told me something I really didn&rsquo;t expect and thought the other way around.</p><p>But being an investigative soul, I kept weighing one option against the other until the day when I had to make a decision and share it with those concerned. On that day, I was able to put into words the constant battle between my heart and my mind. The mind craved safety, freedom and security, while the heart craved challenges, to get out of the comfort zone and find out how far I could go.</p><h2 id=so-what-was-my-gut-feeling class="relative group">So what was my gut feeling? <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style=text-decoration-line:none!important href=#so-what-was-my-gut-feeling aria-label=Anchor>#</a></span></h2><p>It is important to realise that there is no good or bad decision and that no option is permanent. You learn from all decisions and the important thing is to make a decision that calms your heart and mind as much as if they weren&rsquo;t even there, and that, in my humble opinion, is the most important sign that you know your gut feeling about something.</p><p><figure><img src=img/6p2.jpeg alt=pic class="mx-auto my-0 rounded-md"></figure></p><p>I eventually chose the option that felt <strong>more challenging to me</strong> and have since experienced this calm between mind and heart. So I am confident that I was able to follow my gut feeling. How much I can learn from it remains to be seen, of course, and only time will tell how significant this decision is.</p><blockquote><p>I hope that I have been able to help you a little in getting to know your gut feeling about something by sharing this experience. Thank you for your attention.</p></blockquote></div></section><footer class="max-w-prose pt-8 print:hidden"><div class=flex><div class=place-self-center><div class="text-2xl sm:text-lg"></div></div></div><div class=pt-8><hr class="border-dotted border-neutral-300 dark:border-neutral-600"><div class="flex justify-between pt-3"><span><a class="group flex" href=/website/posts/fifth-post/><span class="me-2 text-neutral-700 transition-transform group-hover:-translate-x-[2px] group-hover:text-primary-600 dark:text-neutral dark:group-hover:text-primary-400"><span class="ltr:inline rtl:hidden">&larr;</span><span class="ltr:hidden rtl:inline">&rarr;</span></span>
