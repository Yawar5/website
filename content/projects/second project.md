When, in January 2022, I saw little children going through the rubbish on the streets of Istanbul to collect food scraps, I couldn't help but wonder what role I could play to reduce that child's suffering. Although none of us has a life without problems, it is my humble opinion that seeing people's suffering can help us understand and appreciate what we have even more. Our world is full of such stories and it is very likely that many of us have also struggled in one way or another to get where we are today. 

> With this strategy document, I am taking the first steps to meet exciting and inspiring people who would like to work together to establish a charitable organisation for children's education.  

The strategy of the PS charity is based on four aspects, namely mission, awareness, promotion and support, hereafter referred to as MAPS. A brief description of each of the aspects of MAPS follows.

## Mission 

The charity aims to raise awareness, promote and support the education of orphans and underprivileged children up to the age of eighteen in the developing world. 

## Awareness

The charity plans to hold seminars where both academics and practitioners can come together to discuss opportunities to raise awareness and encourage communities and schools to introduce special education programmes for orphans and underprivileged children in the developing world. 

## Promotion

The charity aims to award annual scholarships to deserving children and create a community among the children to foster a long-term bond between all the students supported by the organisation. The vision here is to create a sense of family and kinship among the children, which can lead to a long-term professional bond between them.

## Support 

The charity intends to join forces to help the underprivileged children of our society by providing them with financial and moral support to get an education. More importantly, through this effort, we want to create a community of young underprivileged children who are educated and then able to solve the daily challenges of our society.

### Approach

Initially, we want to establish a team of active members that will meet bi-weekly and brainstorm on how to further shape the MAPS strategy for our organisation. Eventually, a board of members will be established and the financial structure of the organisation will be formulated. Criteria for deserving students will also be drawn up and the appropriate applications will be made. Then we will conduct fundraising campaigns and establish transparent and secure money flows. Our goal is to be an actively functioning charitable organisation by August 2023. It is important to note that in order to make this dream a reality, we need to join forces and have people with the right expertise at the table. So, in case you know someone who would like to be involved, please forward this message to them. I will be organising the first online general meeting of the organisation sometime in September 2022.
