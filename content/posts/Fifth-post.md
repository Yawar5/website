I am pleased to share that we have successfully completed the relief operation for the flood victims in Pakistan. Thanks to the support of all donors, 570 euros were raised for the flood relief operation through the [gofundme campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/f/joining-hands-to-help-flood-victims-of-pakistan?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cp_guide_do&member=22211107). The money raised was sent to an acquaintance who led the relief operation. The relief operation carried out consisted of the following activities:

> Distribution of 40 food bags, 10 mosquito nets, and pre-cooked food boxes on 6 October. Some photos of the distribution of food/mosquito nets are shown below.

> A free medical camp was set up on 22 October where more than 100 patients received basic medical check-ups. During this camp, medicines for cough, flu, and fever, such as paracetamol and multivitamins, were distributed among the flood victims. Some photos of the medical camp are shown below.
