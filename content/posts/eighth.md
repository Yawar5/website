title: Lessons learned from industry so far

It has been two years since my full-time transition from academia to industry. I was involved in industry long before this full transition, during four years of industrial PhD from 2018 to 2022 to be exact, but in the past two years of full-time work in industry, I have learned a lot of new lessons that I want to summarize here in the following three lessons learned.

## Lesson #1: Mindset matters alot.

While the nature of work and challenge may vary in different work environments, there is one thing that plays a decisive role: *our mindset*. I recognize that we have different personalities and it is important that we find the right match between our personalities and the professional work we are committed to. In addition, I also recognize that perfection or idealism look good on paper, but the practical implementation of such ideas is far from easy. Comfort, relaxation rarely finds its place in the adult world. But in my opinion, it is precisely the pursuit of success in challenging times with the right mindset that brings our true potential to blossom. 

The times can be easy or difficult, the challenge can be big or small, success can seem unlikely or guaranteed, in all these situations our mindset and approach makes or breaks us. The world-famous boxer Mohammad Ali once said

> *If my mind can conceive it, if my heart can believe it then I can achieve it.*  


## Lesson #2: True joy is in collaborative working.

Society often glorifies comfort and happiness as hallmarks of a successful professional life. I am no expert in social science, but I have so far encountered one common theme in my professional experience: Collaboration is far better than dissociation and leads to a more joyful work experience and more satisfied teams. When people commit 40 hours a week of their time to a job, earning financial reward is not the only goal that leads to their peace. 

Aspects such as feeling connected, understood, challenged, independent contribute to their growth and development, and collaboration is a necessary ingredient in this recipe for individual growth. There is profound wisdom in the African proverb

> *If you want to go fast, go alone; but if you want to go far, go together.*



## Lesson #3: Balance between work and private live is crucial.

Finally, as with so many important things in life, balance between work and private life is crucial. Mastery in any profession, among other factors, requires relentless effort in this competitive world, and work-life balance would probably not lead you to mastery. Similarly, satisfaction at work is also not possible with a cowboy or cowgirl behavior where you don't uphold your responsibilities and only blame problems on external factors. Achieving professional success on a personal and team level is challenging and many pieces must fit together before the vault of success can be opened. However, I believe that it is precisely that pursuit that makes work meaningful. 

On the private front, life goes by quickly and there is certainly more to life than work. Family and friends are the most obvious, but so are physical health, spiritual enlightenment and community involvement to name a few. 

The question of how to achieve this work-life balance is excellently answered by Australian author and entrepreneur Jana Kingsford in the following quote 

> *Balance is not something you find, it's something you create.*
