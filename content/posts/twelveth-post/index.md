title: Three Takeaways from 2025
date: 2025-12-28

It's December 28th, and once again I find myself drawn to pause—to reflect, document, be grateful, and strategize for the future. As I've done in recent years, this year too I've revisited my reflections from the past years: 2023 was all about gratitude for travel experiences, embracing risks, and developing a positive mindset; 2024 was about family, friends, and happiness. Seeing how these themes shaped my year and shaped me into where I am today reminds me how valuable this reflection is.

> So here are my three key takeaways from 2025.

## Be in Your Element

To grow, you must know who you are—your strengths and weaknesses, and what truly energizes you. Challenges help us evolve, but it's equally important not to lose sight of your core self amidst the daily grind. Life can pull us in all directions, but by staying aligned with your element keeps you grounded.

For me, that means taking care of my health and fitness, maintaining my work ethic, constantly challenging myself, and facing problems head-on instead of avoiding them. And just like an owl turns its head 270 degrees to survey its surroundings, we can't literally turn 270 degrees—but we can maintain regular contact with the people who know and support us: friends, family, and colleagues. These relationships serve as mirrors, reminding us of who we are and where we're going.

## Life Is Not Just About Me—It’s About Us

As you grow, it becomes clear that life isn’t a solo journey. In my experience, *life not shared is life not lived*. The people around us—our partner, our family, our friends, our mentors, our colleagues—invest in us. With growth comes greater responsibility: to show up thoughtfully, to act with integrity, and to engage with maturity.
This means aligning our individual ambitions with collective goals—building stability, nurturing relationships, and contributing meaningfully to shared paths. These aren’t burdens; they’re opportunities to grow, to give, and to deepen connection. In 2026, I want to honor *us* with the same dedication I give *me*.

## Give Back to Society—Start With What You Have

Society is a web of shared values and norms, and when we are fortunate in any dimension, we have a responsibility to give back. The most authentic way to contribute isn’t always through grand gestures—it often starts small with actions rooted in what you do best. 
Find your gift. Ask yourself what needs to change and how you can help make it happen. For me it begins with simple acts: sharing leftover food with someone in need instead of discarding it, supporting causes that resonate with me, and where possible using my skills to create value for others. Hoping that small, consistent efforts will eventually compound into meaningful contributions.

> In summary: I hope 2026 brings me closer to my element, strengthens the us in my life, and creates opportunities to give back in ways that feel authentic and impactful. May the coming year be joyful, exciting, and full of growth. Wishing you all a wonderful 2026.
