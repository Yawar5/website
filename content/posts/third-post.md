title: Change can be overwhelming, but transformational change leads you to profound growth

I have been going through quite a few changes lately and I thought it might be good to document my thoughts at this stage. Once you feel comfortable in a particular place or situation, it is very overwhelming when you have to change, voluntarily or involuntarily. It is also important to note that people are different. While some of us find it relatively easy or fun to experience change, others may find it stressful or even frightening. 

> With this blog post, I want to share a little from my personal experience of how previous voluntary or non-voluntary changes have affected my life and how I think you can best deal with change. 

First, what do I mean by change. Of course, change is a constant phenomenon and each day is different from the next, but here I am focusing on life-changing events. So, for example, change of country, job, house, relationship status, etc. The impact of such events on our lives is crucial and brings with it a lot of uncertainty. So it makes sense to look back at one's life and see how life-changing events in general have shaped us and what we have learned from them. 

Ancient wisdom and cultures are full of expressions and sayings that emphasise the benefits and significance of change. For example, a famous Dutch quote reads as follows: **Wees de verandering die je in de wereld wil zien gebeuren** which roughly translates to: **Be the change you want to see in the world**.

Reflecting on some of the life-changing events in my life so far, moving to Italy for my bachelors was quite a change. I had no knowledge of Italian culture, traditions or values when I moved there. Looking back on it now, I am very grateful that such a change took place in my life. Not only did I make wonderful friends in Italy, but I also became a much more enlightened person. The same goes for my move to the Netherlands for my masters. 

> When you live in different cultures, your view of life tends to become more holistic and you realise that there are so many ways to live a meaningful and enriching life.

**From my experience so far, I think change is usually a good thing**. Even though it may not seem so in the moment, the long-term benefits of such life-changing events will be well worth it. So how should you act with this frame of mind when going through such changes? 

## Realise change is constant

First and foremost, realize that change is the only true constant in life. So, rather than approaching half heartily and clinging to old habits and associations, it is in our best interest to actually try to embrace the change with a positive outlook.

## Shorten your timeframe

Secondly, depending on the situation, change can be uncomfortable at first or great right away. In both scenarios, I encourage you to shorten your timeframe and focus on the present moment. Think of it as a film that has just started. It is still too early to understand how the film will play out metaphorically speaking. So, whether you have had a major setback in your life or have recently graduated and are at the pinnacle of your ambitions, it is wise to shorten your time frame, not worry about the long-term consequences of this change and live in the present moment.

## Get used to the feeling of change 

Finally, remember this new feeling and get used to it. Life is full of challenges. Today you face this challenge, but tomorrow you may face another. As long as you learn from each challenge and keep working on yourself, life will keep leading you to new horizons.

> My take-home message is this: Approach life-changing events with a positive outlook and realise that change is the only true constant in the world. Embracing change and being comfortable with the idea of change can equip us with the right state of mind needed for profound growth.
