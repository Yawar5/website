It was my pleasure to have a conversation with [Wilbert Wijns](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wilbert-wijns-0669946/) about the meaning of success in life. Wilbert is an experienced professional with profound industrial experience and at the time of recording this video (2 July 2021) he was a programme manager at the Netherlands Railways. In this video I ask Wilbert what success has meant to him over the years and how he has approached this subject in his life.

Some important conclusions from our conversation are the following:

> Wilbert pointed out that "Success" is a relative and personal thing, the meaning of which changes in the course of one's life. 

> He noted that success has elements of learning in it and that to be successful you have to learn how to get up stronger when you have fallen. 

> It is also stated that success is also strongly linked to achieving one's goals. 

> He explained that when one is younger, personal success can be more focused on financial independence and that as one gets older and one's basic needs are met, success shifts more to what one does in life and how one interacts with people.

> We noted that success always involves doing things you have never done before and requires self-confidence. Wilbert used the metaphor that being successful in life is like stepping on the first step of the stairs when you do not know where the stairs will lead you. 

> He also wisely mentioned that being happy with yourself leads to success in life and not the other way around.

Finally, and most importantly, Wilbert suggests that if you ask yourself the following **five questions**, they will lead you to **YOUR** success: 
1.	When do I experience pleasure in the things I do/what activities or work give me pleasure?
2.	Do I take enough time (as quality time) for myself?
3.	Which people around me give me comfort?
4.	Am I free to make my own choices/dare I say NO to things?
5.	What can people wake me up for, even in the middle of the night? (In Dutch better known as: **Daar kun je me 's nachts voor wakker maken!**)

We hope you'll enjoy this conversation. Feel free to get in touch to share your experiences and thoughts on this topic.
