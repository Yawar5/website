In August 2021, after three hours of hiking, Emile and I discuss his journey to entrepreneurship at a beautiful spot on the Italian-Swiss border in the Alps. Where I ask him three questions: 1) What drove him to become an entrepreneur? 2) What challenges does he see for himself in the coming time? 3) What advice or recommendations does he have for others?

I followed up this conversation with him again in May 2021, where after a four-hour hike, Emile and I look back on the past year in which an idea grew into a company called [Nebuly](https://nebuly.ai/). In this follow-up conversation, Emile shares his thoughts on this process and together we try to extract some important learning points. We try to outline the working environments of startups and identify the necessary attributes for people interested in working at startups. We hope you enjoy this conversation.
