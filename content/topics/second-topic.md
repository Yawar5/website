We begin with a general introduction of Miki, which is quickly followed by an in-depth discussion of Miki's journey to self-development and some of the good habits he is pursuing. 

> We agree that building good habits requires willpower, motivation, consistency and keeping track of your habits.

Then follows a very interesting discussion on the benefits and threats of using technology. Miki shares his concerns about the potential threats of the artificial intelligence revolution and some examples where it is already affecting people's lives in a negative way.

> We conclude with an overview of potential threats to artificial intelligence and the possible role of the supernatural in addressing these threats.
