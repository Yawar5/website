Although none of us has a life without problems, it is my humble opinion that seeing people&amp;rsquo;s suffering can help us understand and appreciate what we have even more. Our world is full of such stories and it is very likely that many of us have also struggled in one way or another to get where we are today.</description></item></channel></rss>
