Wilbert is an experienced professional with profound industrial experience and at the time of recording this video (2 July 2021) he was a programme manager at the Netherlands Railways. In this video I ask Wilbert what success has meant to him over the years and how he has approached this subject in his life.\nSome important conclusions from our conversation are the following:\nWilbert pointed out that \u0026ldquo;Success\u0026rdquo; is a relative and personal thing, the meaning of which changes in the course of one\u0026rsquo;s life.\nHe noted that success has elements of learning in it and that to be successful you have to learn how to get up stronger when you have fallen.\nIt is also stated that success is also strongly linked to achieving one\u0026rsquo;s goals.\nHe explained that when one is younger, personal success can be more focused on financial independence and that as one gets older and one\u0026rsquo;s basic needs are met, success shifts more to what one does in life and how one interacts with people.\nWe noted that success always involves doing things you have never done before and requires self-confidence. Wilbert used the metaphor that being successful in life is like stepping on the first step of the stairs when you do not know where the stairs will lead you.\nHe also wisely mentioned that being happy with yourself leads to success in life and not the other way around.\nFinally, and most importantly, Wilbert suggests that if you ask yourself the following five questions, they will lead you to YOUR success:\nWhen do I experience pleasure in the things I do/what activities or work give me pleasure? Do I take enough time (as quality time) for myself? Which people around me give me comfort? Am I free to make my own choices/dare I say NO to things? What can people wake me up for, even in the middle of the night? (In Dutch better known as: Daar kun je me \u0026rsquo;s nachts voor wakker maken!) We hope you\u0026rsquo;ll enjoy this conversation. Feel free to get in touch to share your experiences and thoughts on this topic.\n","date":"16 August 2022","permalink":"/website/posts/fourth-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"It was my pleasure to have a conversation with Wilbert Wijns about the meaning of success in life.","title":"What is success in life?"},{"content":"Welcome to my website.

Once you feel comfortable in a particular place or situation, it is very overwhelming when you have to change, voluntarily or involuntarily. It is also important to note that people are different. While some of us find it relatively easy or fun to experience change, others may find it stressful or even frightening.\nWith this blog post, I want to share a little from my personal experience of how previous voluntary or non-voluntary changes have affected my life and how I think you can best deal with change.\nFirst, what do I mean by change. Of course, change is a constant phenomenon and each day is different from the next, but here I am focusing on life-changing events. So, for example, change of country, job, house, relationship status, etc. The impact of such events on our lives is crucial and brings with it a lot of uncertainty. So it makes sense to look back at one\u0026rsquo;s life and see how life-changing events in general have shaped us and what we have learned from them.\nAncient wisdom and cultures are full of expressions and sayings that emphasise the benefits and significance of change. For example, a famous Dutch quote reads as follows: Wees de verandering die je in de wereld wil zien gebeuren which roughly translates to: Be the change you want to see in the world.\nReflecting on some of the life-changing events in my life so far, moving to Italy for my bachelors was quite a change. I had no knowledge of Italian culture, traditions or values when I moved there. Looking back on it now, I am very grateful that such a change took place in my life. Not only did I make wonderful friends in Italy, but I also became a much more enlightened person. The same goes for my move to the Netherlands for my masters.\nWhen you live in different cultures, your view of life tends to become more holistic and you realise that there are so many ways to live a meaningful and enriching life.\nFrom my experience so far, I think change is usually a good thing. Even though it may not seem so in the moment, the long-term benefits of such life-changing events will be well worth it. So how should you act with this frame of mind when going through such changes?\nRealise change is constant # First and foremost, realize that change is the only true constant in life. So, rather than approaching half heartily and clinging to old habits and associations, it is in our best interest to actually try to embrace the change with a positive outlook.\nShorten your timeframe # Secondly, depending on the situation, change can be uncomfortable at first or great right away. In both scenarios, I encourage you to shorten your timeframe and focus on the present moment. Think of it as a film that has just started. It is still too early to understand how the film will play out metaphorically speaking. So, whether you have had a major setback in your life or have recently graduated and are at the pinnacle of your ambitions, it is wise to shorten your time frame, not worry about the long-term consequences of this change and live in the present moment.\nGet used to the feeling of change # Finally, remember this new feeling and get used to it. Life is full of challenges. Today you face this challenge, but tomorrow you may face another. As long as you learn from each challenge and keep working on yourself, life will keep leading you to new horizons.\nMy take-home message is this: Approach life-changing events with a positive outlook and realise that change is the only true constant in the world. Embracing change and being comfortable with the idea of change can equip us with the right state of mind needed for profound growth.\n","date":"7 August 2022","permalink":"/website/posts/third-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"I have been going through quite a few changes lately and I thought it might be good to document my thoughts at this stage.","title":"Change can be overwhelming, but transformational change leads you to profound growth"},{"content":"This section contains all the projects I am currently involved in.\n","date":"24 July 2022","permalink":"/website/projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"This section contains all the projects I am currently involved in.","title":"Projects"},{"content":"When, in January 2022, I saw little children going through the rubbish on the streets of Istanbul to collect food scraps, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but wonder what role I could play to reduce that child\u0026rsquo;s suffering. Although none of us has a life without problems, it is my humble opinion that seeing people\u0026rsquo;s suffering can help us understand and appreciate what we have even more. Our world is full of such stories and it is very likely that many of us have also struggled in one way or another to get where we are today.\nWith this strategy document, I am taking the first steps to meet exciting and inspiring people who would like to work together to establish a charitable organisation for children\u0026rsquo;s education.\nThe strategy of the PS charity is based on four aspects, namely mission, awareness, promotion and support, hereafter referred to as MAPS. A brief description of each of the aspects of MAPS follows.\nMission # The charity aims to raise awareness, promote and support the education of orphans and underprivileged children up to the age of eighteen in the developing world.\nAwareness # The charity plans to hold seminars where both academics and practitioners can come together to discuss opportunities to raise awareness and encourage communities and schools to introduce special education programmes for orphans and underprivileged children in the developing world.\nPromotion # The charity aims to award annual scholarships to deserving children and create a community among the children to foster a long-term bond between all the students supported by the organisation. The vision here is to create a sense of family and kinship among the children, which can lead to a long-term professional bond between them.\nSupport # The charity intends to join forces to help the underprivileged children of our society by providing them with financial and moral support to get an education. More importantly, through this effort, we want to create a community of young underprivileged children who are educated and then able to solve the daily challenges of our society.\nApproach # Initially, we want to establish a team of active members that will meet bi-weekly and brainstorm on how to further shape the MAPS strategy for our organisation. Eventually, a board of members will be established and the financial structure of the organisation will be formulated. Criteria for deserving students will also be drawn up and the appropriate applications will be made. Then we will conduct fundraising campaigns and establish transparent and secure money flows. Our goal is to be an actively functioning charitable organisation by August 2023. It is important to note that in order to make this dream a reality, we need to join forces and have people with the right expertise at the table. So, in case you know someone who would like to be involved, please forward this message to them. I will be organising the first online general meeting of the organisation sometime in September 2022.\nFinally, if the concept of this charity organisation appeals to you personally and you would like to be involved in this effort, please fill out this form.

Having spent only four days in the country and travelled a little, I am filled with appreciation and admiration for this country. It is worth noting that I have seen this pattern repeat itself so many times: we are filled with all kinds of wrong assumptions and prejudices about countries all over the world, but when we actually visit them, we are pleasantly surprised by their hospitality, openness and cultural values. I have come to the profound realisation that materialistic development does not always guarantee hospitality and cohesion in a society and that today\u0026rsquo;s world is a complex place from which we, as individuals, can learn a lot from each culture.\nWith this blog, I would therefore like to challenge you to take a different path when it comes to forming opinions and views about other countries.\nI will share with you some of my personal principles that I try to live by after having travelled numerous countries in the past ten years. I have developed these principles over the years, from the good old days when I was a broke student to the more financially prosperous days of being a PhD student. So let us begin:\nPrinciple 1: Form your own opinion instead of blindly believing what you hear from others # As I mentioned, today\u0026rsquo;s world is more complex than we can comprehend. Each individual is a universe in itself. As we grow up, we tend to develop a keen sense of understanding of the people around us and the norms and traditions of our society. While it is always good to constantly check our beliefs and attitudes, it is especially important when we meet people from backgrounds that are foreign and unfamiliar to us. This is especially necessary since most of us have never been to these foreign countries and usually rely on rumours or opinionated reports in the media. I encourage you to form your own opinion by visiting those countries yourself or making friends with people from those countries. I am convinced that, in most cases, you will find that society\u0026rsquo;s prevailing views on foreign countries are often inaccurate or rather present a very simple one-dimensional picture of a complex society. In order to get a better picture, I encourage you to travel more and form your own opinions as a result.\nPrinciple 2: Try to immerse yourself in the local culture and way of life when travelling # When I visit a new place, I try to get to know the culture and way of life of that place rather than having a relaxed and luxurious holiday. I believe that by immersing yourself in the local culture, you can experience the daily challenges upfront. You can also find new ways of solving problems by observing cultural solutions to different social problems up close. From the Danish \u0026lsquo;Hygge\u0026rsquo; cafes to the cosy local tea stalls of Turkey, you can see how people comfort themselves and enjoy life on an ordinary day.\nPrinciple 3: Seek help from local people rather than on the Internet # This principle is quite simple. By asking local people for directions to the city centre or asking for restaurant recommendations, you allow yourself to connect with locals. It\u0026rsquo;s a mindset shift where you focus on being present in your surroundings rather than on the boring screens of your phone. In addition, you can not only experience people\u0026rsquo;s hospitality and possibly make new friendships, but also hone your own communication and social skills.\nPrinciple 4: Analyse the lifestyle of young and old, rich and poor people # Every society is composed of well-off people and those who struggle to afford the basic necessities of life. I encourage you to actively observe and analyse people\u0026rsquo;s lifestyles when you travel. Try to recognise clear patterns between young and old and between rich and poor. More importantly, if you get the chance to discuss these patterns with the locals, even better. Ideally, all of us should live responsible lives and make a positive contribution to our society. But to do that, we need to develop an accurate understanding of the world. By analysing different societies as we travel, we essentially improve our understanding of the world, which leads us to act more responsibly within our societies.\nPrinciple 5: Walk around the main areas of the city so that you have mapped it in your mind # The last principle is meant to expand your existence in a metaphysical sense. When we are in a particular physical space, we are PRESENT there at that moment. By actually walking around the city and mapping the different streets and shops in your mind, you are living that presence. Another important benefit of this principle, apart from burning calories and staying physically fit, is that you learn to appreciate and value architecture and human development, despite all its shortcomings, which of course have to be addressed.\nConclusion # So there you have it, five principles that offer a new perspective on travelling and will help you not only to have a more meaningful travel experience, but also to get a more accurate picture of human society. I invite you to try them out next time you visit a new place and refine them according to your personal preferences.\nMy take-home message is this: Try to immerse yourself as much as possible in a culture or a society, observe and analyse the lifestyle of the people, seek help from the locals and experience their way of life, before you form a strong opinion about a human society\n","date":"8 July 2022","permalink":"/website/posts/second-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"When our plane was about to land at Bucharest International Airport, I was full of all kinds of questions and prejudices about Romania.","title":"Five principles for a great travelling experience"},{"content":"In August 2021, after three hours of hiking, Emile and I discuss his journey to entrepreneurship at a beautiful spot on the Italian-Swiss border in the Alps.

Although this question can be answered from various angles, such as providing a detailed description of the identified research gaps followed by a critical analysis of the methodologies used and results gathered for each of the eight papers, my focus here is rather simple and straightforward. I would like to share with you some rather more personal and somewhat surprising aspects of the writing of the eight papers. So let us begin:\nLesson 1: Reward is more personal than social # Let\u0026rsquo;s face it, most of you (dear readers) who will come across this post are people who know me personally or were recommended this article by one of our mutual acquaintances. The chance that any of you have actually read all eight papers I have written is considerably small and that is exactly my point. The real readers of your work, people who will pick up your ideas and test their validity in the real world, will probably never cross your path. The people around you are more likely to notice that you were stressed to meet deadlines, that you skipped social gatherings or that you were mentally absent from social gatherings while trying to get your articles across the finish line and eventually receive a link of published articles. Personally, I perform better when I concentrate on one project at a time. But that means other projects and aspects of your life can be affected. When I wrote my first papers, I was totally focused on finishing the best possible draft and submitting it for further consideration. Instead of hanging out with my friends on Friday nights, I worked on the r-studio code of my research data to test different hypotheses and identify new interdependencies. I vividly remember many such incidents where I had to prioritise my precious papers over other, more interesting social events. So one might naturally wonder what all this is about and what I have learned from it.\nThe first crucial thing I learned was that the “reward” is rather more personal than social. Starting from an idea and than going through all the ups and downs of paper writing and publishing process strengthens your mind. You learn that to trust yourself and become more patient. Having a self belief that you can handle the ups and down of life is probably the best armour one can have and no matter how you acquire it that is what you need to shape your dreams into reality. You also learn to become more humble and modest because you realize that your success is the result of all the people who supported you in this process. I am grateful to all the support I received and hope to be a good support to people in my social surroundings. Finally, here are two photos of me that I found, for the history books :D (just kidding), to document my personal growth over the years.\nLesson 2: Journey is more important than the destination # When I look back, I remember the stories associated with each of the eight papers. Like when I had two major revisions right before the holidays and had to adjust my focus and go into peak performance mode instead of holiday mode in a matter of days. What I learned is that a challenge brings out the best in you. When the stacks are against you and you are cornered, you can do wonders. There are countless examples in sport where an underdog team ends up winning the championship. The point is that we should start enjoying the journey we are on and not worry too much about the destination. Just like when, on a hike in the Italian Alps, I focused on the next step on this path and got to see amazing views.\nWe are naturally used to associating success with the achievement of milestones. So in my case, the publication of a paper should be a success. While that is partly true, I think the real success is learning to deal with the stress and time pressure involved in the publishing process and developing the necessary skills to work with your co-authors. If I had not received major revisions and my papers were just accepted after the first submission, I would never have learned how to concentrate and stay calm under extreme time pressure.\nConclusion # To sum up, I feel that writing eight papers in four years has made me a better person, not because I now have eight publications, but because this process has made me more confident, more patient, more humble and more modest.\nMy take-home message is this: learn to enjoy the journey you are on and remember that the greatest reward for all your hard work is that you become a better version of yourself and become someone you and your loved ones can be proud of\n","date":"25 June 2022","permalink":"/website/posts/first-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"What have I learned from writing eight papers over the past four years?","title":"Two lessons I learned from writing eight papers"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/website/about/","section":"Yawar's website","summary":"","title":"About me"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/website/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/website/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
